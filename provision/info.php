<?php
  //phpinfo â€” Outputs information about PHP's configuration
  //Outputs a large amount of information about the current state of PHP. This includes information about PHP compilation options and extensions, the PHP version, server information and environment (if compiled as a module), the PHP environment, OS version information, paths, master and local values of configuration options, HTTP headers, and the PHP License.
  //Because every system is setup differently, phpinfo() is commonly used to check configuration settings and for available predefined variables on a given system.
  //phpinfo() is also a valuable debugging tool as it contains all EGPCS (Environment, GET, POST, Cookie, Server) data.
