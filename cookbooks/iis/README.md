- `auto_shutdown_params` - Specifies command-line parameters for the executable that is specified in the autoShutdownExe attribute. - optional

#### CPU Items
- `cpu_action` - Configures the action that IIS takes when a worker process exceeds its configured CPU limit. The action attribute is configured on a per-application pool basis. - Available options [:NoAction, :KillW3wp, :Throttle, :ThrottleUnderLoad] - default is :NoAction - optional
- `cpu_limit` - Configures the maximum percentage of CPU time (in 1/1000ths of one percent) that the worker processes in an application pool are allowed to consume over a period of time as indicated by the resetInterval attribute. If the limit set by the limit attribute is exceeded, an event is written to the event log and an optional set of events can be triggered. These optional events are determined by the action attribute. - default is 0 - optional
- `cpu_reset_interval` - Specifies the reset period (in minutes) for CPU monitoring and throttling limits on an application pool.

### Example

```ruby
# creates a new app pool
iis_pool 'myAppPool_v1_1' do
  runtime_version "2.0"
  pipeline_mode :Classic
  action :add
end
```

iis_app
--------

Creates an application in IIS.

### Actions

- `:add` - add a new application pool
- `:delete` - delete an existing application pool

### Attribute Parameters

- `site_name` - name attribute. The name of the site to add this app to
- `path` -The virtual path for this application
- `application_pool` - The pool this application belongs to
- `physical_path` - The physical path where this app resides.
- `enabled_protocols` - The enabled protocols that this app provides (http, https, net.pipe, net.tcp, etc)

### Example

```ruby
# creates a new app
iis_app "myApp" do
  path "/v1_1"
  application_pool "myAppPool_v1_1"
  physical_path "#{node['iis']['docroot']}/testfu/v1_1"
  enabled_protocols "http,net.pipe"
  action :add
end
```

iis_vdir
---------

Allows easy management of IIS virtual directories (i.e. vdirs).

### Actions

- :add: - add a new virtual directory
- :delete: - delete an existing virtual directory
- :config: - configure a virtual directory

### Attribute Parameters

- `application_name`: name attribute. Specifies the name of the application attribute.  This is the name of the website or application you are adding it to.
- `path`: The virtual directory path on the site.
- `physical_path`: The physical path of the virtual directory on the disk.
- `username`: (optional) The username required to logon to the physical_path. If set to "" will clear username and password.
- `password`: (optional) The password required to logon to the physical_path
- `logon_method`: (optional, default: :ClearText) The method used to logon (:Interactive, :Batch, :Network, :ClearText). For more information on these types, see "LogonUser Function", Read more at [MSDN](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa378184.aspx)
- `allow_sub_dir_config`: (optional, default: true) Boolean that specifies whether or not the Web server will look for configuration files located in the subdirectories of this virtual directory. Setting this to false can improve performance on servers with very large numbers of web.config files, but doing so prevents IIS configuration from being read in subdirectories.

### Examples

```ruby
# add a virtual directory to default application
iis_vdir 'Default Web Site/' do
  action :add
  path '/Content/Test'
  physical_path 'C:\wwwroot\shared\test'
end
```

```ruby
# add a virtual directory to an application under a site
iis_vdir 'Default Web Site/my application' do
  action :add
  path '/Content/Test'
  physical_path 'C:\wwwroot\shared\test'
end
```

```ruby
# adds a virtual directory to default application which points to a smb share. (Remember to escape the "\"'s)
iis_vdir 'Default Web Site/' do
  action :add
  path '/Content/Test'
  physical_path '\\\\sharename\\sharefolder\\1'
end
```

```ruby
# configure a virtual directory to have a username and password
iis_vdir 'Default Web Site/' do
  action :config
  path '/Content/Test'
  username 'domain\myspecialuser'
  password 'myspecialpassword'
end
```

```ruby
# delete a virtual directory from the default application
iis_vdir 'Default Web Site/' do
  action :delete
  path '/Content/Test'
end
```

iis_section
---------

Allows for the locking/unlocking of sections ([listed here](http://www.iis.net/configreference) or via the command `appcmd list config \"\"  /config:* /xml`)

This is valuable to allow the `web.config` of an individual application/website control it's own settings.

### Actions

- `:lock`: - locks the `section` passed
- `:unlock`: - unlocks the `section` passed

### Attribute Parameters

- `section`: The name of the section to lock.
- `returns`: The result of the `shell_out` command.

### Examples

```ruby
# Sets the IIS global windows authentication to be locked globally
iis_section 'locks global configuration of windows auth' do
  section 'system.webServer/security/authentication/windowsAuthentication'
  action :lock
end
```

```ruby
# Sets the IIS global Basic authentication to be locked globally
iis_section 'locks global configuration of Basic auth' do
  section 'system.webServer/security/authentication/basicAuthentication'
  action :lock
end
```

```ruby
# Sets the IIS global windows authentication to be unlocked globally
iis_section 'unlocked web.config globally for windows auth' do
  action :unlock
  section 'system.webServer/security/authentication/windowsAuthentication'
end
```

```ruby
# Sets the IIS global Basic authentication to be unlocked globally
iis_section 'unlocked web.config globally for Basic auth' do
  action :unlock
  section 'system.webServer/security/authentication/basicAuthentication'
end
```

iis_module
--------

### Actions

- `:add` - add a new module
- `:delete` - delete a module

### Attribute Parameters

- `module_name` - The name of the module to add or delete
- `type` - The type of module
- `precondition` - precondition for module
- `application` - The application or site to add the module to

### Example

```ruby
# Adds a module called "My 3rd Party Module" to mySite/
iis_module "My 3rd Party Module" do
  application "mySite/"
  precondition "bitness64"
  action :add
end
```

```ruby
# Adds a module called "MyModule" to all IIS sites on the server
iis_module "MyModule"
```


Usage
=====

default
-------

Installs and configures IIS 7.0/7.5/8.0 using the default configuration.

mod_*
-----

This cookbook also contains recipes for installing individual IIS modules (extensions).  These recipes can be included in a node's run_list to build the minimal desired custom IIS installation.

* `mod_aspnet` - installs ASP.NET runtime components
* `mod_aspnet45` - installs ASP.NET 4.5 runtime components
* `mod_auth_basic` - installs Basic Authentication support
* `mod_auth_windows` - installs Windows Authentication (authenticate clients by using NTLM or Kerberos) support
* `mod_compress_dynamic` - installs dynamic content compression support. *PLEASE NOTE* - enabling dynamic compression always gives you more efficient use of bandwidth, but if your server's processor utilization is already very high, the CPU load imposed by dynamic compression might make your site perform more slowly.
* `mod_compress_static` - installs static content compression support
* `mod_iis6_metabase_compat` - installs IIS 6 Metabase Compatibility component.
* `mod_isapi` - installs ISAPI (Internet Server Application Programming Interface) extension and filter support.
* `mod_logging` - installs and enables HTTP Logging (logging of Web site activity), Logging Tools (logging tools and scripts) and Custom Logging (log any of the HTTP request/response headers, IIS server variables, and client-side fields with simple configuration) support
* `mod_management` - installs Web server Management Console which supports management of local and remote Web servers
* `mod_security` - installs URL Authorization (Authorizes client access to the URLs that comprise a Web application), Request Filtering (configures rules to block selected client requests) and IP Security (allows or denies content access based on IP address or domain name) support.
* `mod_tracing` -  installs support for tracing ASP.NET applications and failed requests.

Note: Not every possible IIS module has a corresponding recipe. The foregoing recipes are included for convenience, but users may also place additional IIS modules that are installable as Windows features into the ``node['iis']['components']`` array.
