To specify the process ID of the orphaned process, use %1%. - optional\n- `rapid_fail_protection` - Setting to true instructs the WWW service to remove from service all applications that are in an application pool - default is true - optional\n- `rapid_fail_protection_interval` - Specifies the number of minutes before the failure count for a process is reset. - default is '00:05:00' - optional\n- `rapid_fail_protection_max_crashes` - Specifies the maximum number of failures that are allowed within the number of minutes specified by the rapidFailProtectionInterval attribute. - default is 5 - optional\n- `auto_shutdown_exe` - Specifies an executable to run when the WWW service shuts down an application pool. - optional\n- `auto_shutdown_params` - Specifies command-line parameters for the executable that is specified in the autoShutdownExe attribute. - optional\n\n#### CPU Items\n- `cpu_action` - Configures the action that IIS takes when a worker process exceeds its configured CPU limit. The action attribute is configured on a per-application pool basis. - Available options [:NoAction, :KillW3wp, :Throttle, :ThrottleUnderLoad] - default is :NoAction - optional\n- `cpu_limit` - Configures the maximum percentage of CPU time (in 1/1000ths of one percent) that the worker processes in an application pool are allowed to consume over a period of time as indicated by the resetInterval attribute. If the limit set by the limit attribute is exceeded, an event is written to the event log and an optional set of events can be triggered. These optional events are determined by the action attribute. - default is 0 - optional\n- `cpu_reset_interval` - Specifies the reset period (in minutes) for CPU monitoring and throttling limits on an application pool. When the number of minutes elapsed since the last process accounting reset equals the number specified by this property, IIS resets the CPU timers for both the logging and limit intervals. - default is '00:05:00' - optional\n- `cpu_smp_affinitized` - Specifies whether a particular worker process assigned to an application pool should also be assigned to a given CPU. - default is false - optional\n- `smp_processor_affinity_mask` - Specifies the hexadecimal processor mask for multi-processor computers, which indicates to which CPU the worker processes in an application pool should be bound.

The name of the site to add this app to\n- `path` -The virtual path for this application\n- `application_pool` - The pool this application belongs to\n- `physical_path` - The physical path where this app resides.\n- `enabled_protocols` - The enabled protocols that this app provides (http, https, net.pipe, net.tcp, etc)\n\n### Example\n\n```ruby\n# creates a new app\niis_app \"myApp\" do\n  path \"/v1_1\"\n  application_pool \"myAppPool_v1_1\"\n  physical_path \"#{node['iis']['docroot']}/testfu/v1_1\"\n  enabled_protocols \"http,net.pipe\"\n  action :add\nend\n```\n\niis_vdir\n---------\n\nAllows easy management of IIS virtual directories (i.e. vdirs).\n\n### Actions\n\n- :add: - add a new virtual directory\n- :delete: - delete an existing virtual directory\n- :config: - configure a virtual directory\n\n### Attribute Parameters\n\n- `application_name`: name attribute. Specifies the name of the application attribute.  This is the name of the website or application you are adding it to.\n- `path`: The virtual directory path on the site.\n- `physical_path`: The physical path of the virtual directory on the disk.\n- `username`: (optional) The username required to logon to the physical_path.

Setting this to false can improve performance on servers with very large numbers of web.config files, but doing so prevents IIS configuration from being read in subdirectories.\n\n### Examples\n\n```ruby\n# add a virtual directory to default application\niis_vdir 'Default Web Site/' do\n  action :add\n  path '/Content/Test'\n  physical_path 'C:\\wwwroot\\shared\\test'\nend\n```\n\n```ruby\n# add a virtual directory to an application under a site\niis_vdir 'Default Web Site/my application' do\n  action :add\n  path '/Content/Test'\n  physical_path 'C:\\wwwroot\\shared\\test'\nend\n```\n\n```ruby\n# adds a virtual directory to default application which points to a smb share.

These recipes can be included in a node's run_list to build the minimal desired custom IIS installation.\n\n* `mod_aspnet` - installs ASP.NET runtime components\n* `mod_aspnet45` - installs ASP.NET 4.5 runtime components\n* `mod_auth_basic` - installs Basic Authentication support\n* `mod_auth_windows` - installs Windows Authentication (authenticate clients by using NTLM or Kerberos) support\n* `mod_compress_dynamic` - installs dynamic content compression support. *PLEASE NOTE* - enabling dynamic compression always gives you more efficient use of bandwidth, but if your server's processor utilization is already very high, the CPU load imposed by dynamic compression might make your site perform more slowly.\n* `mod_compress_static` - installs static content compression support\n* `mod_iis6_metabase_compat` - installs IIS 6 Metabase Compatibility component.\n* `mod_isapi` - installs ISAPI (Internet Server Application Programming Interface) extension and filter support.\n* `mod_logging` - installs and enables HTTP Logging (logging of Web site activity), Logging Tools (logging tools and scripts) and Custom Logging (log any of the HTTP request/response headers, IIS server variables, and client-side fields with simple configuration) support\n* `mod_management` - installs Web server Management Console which supports management of local and remote Web servers\n* `mod_security` - installs URL Authorization (Authorizes client access to the URLs that comprise a Web application), Request Filtering (configures rules to block selected client requests) and IP Security (allows or denies content access based on IP address or domain name) support.\n* `mod_tracing` -  installs support for tracing ASP.NET applications and failed requests.\n\nNote: Not every possible IIS module has a corresponding recipe. The foregoing recipes are included for convenience, but users may also place additional IIS modules that are installable as Windows features into the ``node['iis']['components']`` array.\n\nLicense and Author\n==================\n\n* Author:: Seth Chisamore (<schisamo@chef.io>)\n* Author:: Julian Dunn (<jdunn@chef.io>)\n\nCopyright:: 2011-2013, Chef Software, Inc.\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n",
